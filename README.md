# TODO cli app

A simple CLI todo app written in Go. The goal of this project was to learn go without tutorials just by tinkering around.
Overall I learnt the basics of golang and really enjoy it, this could be my new Python.

## Challengs I faced

Figuring out how to integrate file handling with the CSV package was quite challeging, as well as handling every error that could occur and checking user inputs

## What I would change

If i were to rewrite this or update it, I would put all the function that handle the CSV file in a seperate module. I would also change my way of updating and removing entries as rewriting the entire file is over the top and unecessary.
